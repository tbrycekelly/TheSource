\title{Calculate k (Reuer)}
\usage{
calc.k.reuer(time, wtime, wspeed, mld, SST, teeter.mod = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{the time at which you are calculating k for}

\item{wtime}{a vector of times at which a wind speed is recorded}

\item{wspeed}{a vector of prior windspeeds ordered from most recent to oldest}

\item{mld}{mixed layer depth in meters}

\item{SST}{mixed layer temperature in C}

\item{teeter.mod}{a boolean flag to turn on or off the modified version of Reuer's weighting scheme as outlined in Teeter et al. 2018.}
}
\value{
It will return a list with the individual weights and weighted sum (for dianostics), the k value (that you want, m/d), the instantaneous k (also useful, m/d), k.hist showing the history of k values (diagnostic), and time is time before measurement that each diagnostic is referenced against (for diagnostics, d).
}
\description{
This function calculates the temporal length scale of the NCP measurement, aka a piston velocity (m/d). Essentially it calculates the ventilation based on water column and wind speed over a sequence of wind speed measurements (at 10 m height).
